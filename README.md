# Stock-Price-Prediction
The project was built in process of learning and the outcomes are not to be trusted, I would not invest real money based on this but you do you. 
I have used a 5 layer LSTM to predict the prices, which is about 5000 params. However, Stacked LSTMs are not going to be my personally chosen models to 
work with stock prices.
